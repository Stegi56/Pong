    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Pong. </h3>
    <p>
	Bootcamp is the first time I have coded in Java and throughout I learned many methods.
    I decided that the best way to show my knowledge of them would be through a pong game.
    <p>
    To make it more interesting I decided to add my own twist where items drop down and can
    modify the parameters in the classes I have created such ball size and velocity and the
    number of ball objects in the game.
    <p>
    The hardest part for me was making the algorithm for the paddle ball bounce physics, I
      eventually solved it after breaking the problem down by making a sketch.
    <p>
    I am very satisfied with the result I managed to achieve in 4 days.

            <h3>Spring java game coursework. </h3>
            <p>
                During my java module in spring I had to make a game using the city box 2d engine. So I
                decided to make a 3 level, procedurally generated platform game.
            <p>
                Each level has unique objectives and enemies to defeat, during this I learned how to implement
                features such as menus using the intelij swing ui editor. Implementing file saving and loading
                for a scoreboard and to preserve game state after closing the game and got to practice other
                java skills.
            <p>
                The hardest part for was making a procedurally level generation algorithm. I wanted my levels to
                be unique and random every time. But throughout writing the method to generate levels I realised
                that I had to implement a lot more cases, bounds and parameters than I initially expected -
                in order to have the levels playable and at the same time be seemingly naturally constructed.
            <p>
                I learned many useful skills during this coursework and now feel confident with java programing.
